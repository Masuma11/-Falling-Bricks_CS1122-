The overall game we plan to implement is quite similar to dodge falling object games, where the player dodges objescts that are falling from the top of the screen. The challenge of the game is see if you can beat the highest score. The game becomes increasingly challenging every 5 seconds, increasing the amount of blocks fallen and increasing the speed at which the blocks are falling. Blocks are randomly generated.
