The overall game we plan to implement is quite similar to dodge falling object games, where the player dodges objescts that are falling from the top of the screen. The challenge of the game is see if you can beat the highest score. The game becomes increasingly challenging every 5 seconds as more blocks will fall at an increasing speeds. Blocks are randomly generated.  We allso plan to have the player shoot bullets to decrease the block size so the player can have a higher chance of surviving as the game goes on.  The highscore would be continuously saved and recalled everytime the game starts.
